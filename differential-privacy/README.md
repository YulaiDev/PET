# PET
Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are innovative solutions designed to protect personal data during collection, processing, analysis, and sharing, thereby minimizing privacy risks while enabling valuable data utilization. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Key Developments in PETs:

1.	Advanced Cryptographic Techniques:
      o	Homomorphic Encryption: Allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting it, ensuring data privacy throughout processing.
      o	Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): Enables multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function over their inputs while          keeping those inputs private.
      o	Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the       validity of the statement.
2.	Federated Learning:
      o	A machine learning approach where models are trained across decentralized devices holding local data samples without exchanging        the data itself, thus preserving privacy.
3.	Differential Privacy:
      o	A technique that adds controlled noise to datasets or queries, ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of a single data point         does not significantly affect the outcome, thereby protecting individual privacy.
4.	Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):
      o	Hardware-based environments that securely process sensitive data and code, isolating them from the rest of the system to prevent       unauthorized access.
5.	Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing Frameworks:
      o	Initiatives like Google's Privacy Sandbox aim to develop web standards that allow for user information to be shared for                advertising purposes without compromising individual privacy.
